# MongoDB Configurator

The MongDB Configurator is a utility for creating and managing Versioned MongoDB Configurations, specifically schema validation, indexing, and version migrations when needed. The configurator provides a containerized packaging of database configurations, and a web application that makes it easy to create and test those configurations.

## Quick Start

### A Note about using the Playground
If you think you will want to save your configurations, you should create your own configuration repository by creating a new GitHub repo using [this Template](https://github.com/agile-learning-institute/mongodb_configurator_template), and follow the getting started there.

### Prerequisites
- [Docker Desktop](https://docs.docker.com/get-started/get-docker/) - it's free (for you)
- [Mongo Compass](https://www.mongodb.com/try/download/compass) - Optional
  - Playground connection string: ``mongodb://localhost:27017/``

### Configurator Install

  Use the commands below to download this [docker-compose](./docker-compose.yaml) file and run the Configurator. Then visit http://localhost:8082 to access the Configurator. 

```bash
mkdir Configurator
cd Configurator
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/agile-learning-institute/mongodb_configurator/refs/heads/main/docker-compose.yaml -o docker-compose.yaml
docker compose up -d
```

### Shutdown
When you are done playing, you can use this command to shut down the service.
```bash
docker compose down
```

  **Note**: Shutting down the service will reset the playground to it's starting state. If you want to save all the files you have created in the playground, see [the API Explorer](http://localhost:8081/docs/index.html) for information on API commands you can use to get the documents. 

--- 

### Troubleshooting
First, make sure you have the latest containers with
```bash
docker compose pull
```

The playground service needs ports 27017, 8081, and 8082 to be available.
